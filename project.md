# Project Description for CSCW Course Summer 2018

(Note the following will be updated frequently to add more details and refine expectations, due dates are not expected to change)

## General information

- The project will be completed in groups of 3-4 students (if the group size shrinks, this will be taken into consideration in terms of the project scope/grading).  For the most part, undergraduates and graduates should work together. 
- The grades you will receive in part will be determined by your individual contribution to the project.
- Check the project and cool-reads channels on Slack https://cscwuvic2018.slack.com/ for ideas and resources that may help with ideas or resources for your project.

## Important dates
- June 7th, project pitches are due to be presented in class
- June 8th, project proposals are due (integrating feedback from the presentation)
- Project updates, oral presentations in class: June 28th
- Project interim reports: June 29th (integrating feedback from the presentation)
- Final project presentations in class: July 26th
- Final project reports: August 3rd 

## Project Types

There are many types of possible project formats!  To get an idea of what may be possible, read through CSCW proceedings to see the possible range of projects and papers that could be possible.  I describe some project template ideas below but there are many more!  I will give you guidance throughout the term on what is expected and how you can tailor your approach.

**Design project:** The idea of the project is to take knowledge about CSCW theories that you are gaining in the class (through readings but also your own research)
and apply that knowledge to a real world collaboration problem. You are free to choose whatever application domain you like as long as the scope of the project is reasonable. 
To build this project prototype, you may use any existing components or toolkits.  Designing a chatbot to support collaboration is one approach some of you may wish to consider!

Your report will summarize the theories you build on, the collaboration problem you address, your proposed solution, how you will evaluate the solution (ideally with real users), and the findings from your design study summarizing how your findings may support or add to existing CSCW theories. 

**Empirical study project:** You will design a research experiment (or other type of empirical study, e.g., case study) 
related to some aspect of CSCW. Your report will resemble an evaluation paper you may find at the CSCW conference.  
You will explain the need for your experiment or study, and its contribution relative to related research.  
You will need to justify and describe your study design, your findings from the study and lessons learned. 

**Survey project:** You will choose a research topic in CSCW and write a systematic literature review related to this area (consider the Moca paper as an example of this type of project). 
Your review should summarize / classify the literature in some way. In addition, a good review will go beyond 
summarizing the literature; it will also identify open areas / directions for future research.  There are formal techniques (such as mapping study technique) you may follow if you choose this project option. This paper](http://www.robertfeldt.net/publications/petersen_ease08_sysmap_studies_in_se.pdf) provides an overview of how to do systematic mapping studies in software engineering. 

## Marking details

The project is worth 40%/45% of your final grade (for grads and undergrads respectively). 
Note the graduate student projects are expected to be more comprehensive. 

The project breakdown is as follows:

- Proposal pitch presentation (5%)
- Written Proposal (5%)
- Interim Report and preliminary demo/presentation of project (10%)
- Project intellectual contribution (e.g., tool design, evaluation, framework, theory development) (50%)
- Final presentation (10%)
- Final Report (20%)

Note 1: Your final project mark may be adjusted according to other factors, including things such as improvement over time, individual participation within a group, etc.

Note 2: All students are expected to participate equally in discussions, research, design and development for the projects. The instructor will make marking adjustments for individual students where this participation has not occurred; this may result in a failing grade for the project. At the mid-point and conclusion of the project you will be asked to evaluate your colleagues on the team. Your peer review score and participation on Github/Slack will strongly influence what percentage of the project mark you get.

Note 3: To receive a grade of A+, your project should have some kind of research contribution that could (with some additional work) be suitable for submission to a conference, or solve a demonstrated important real world problem. 

## Submission details 

### Project pitch and proposals

Prepare a **5 min pitch presentation** with three to five slides (upload or add a link to a Slack channel before class).  Your pitch should describe what you hope to achieve, why you work on this project, what process you will follow, and any risks you may anticipate.

The **proposal** will vary depending on the kind of project you decide to work on and should only be about two pages long submitted as markdown on GitHub. List the main milestones you plan to meet in your project (these are likely to be updated throughout the term!)

**Design & Analysis projects should include:**
Description of the target application, users, and task(s). 
A very brief description / sketch of your proposed solution and / or tools you will use (not expected to be well developed at this stage), for design projects, please also include evaluation method you may use. 

**Empirical study projects should include:**
The research question you propose to answer.  
Why this research question is interesting and relevant. 
A very brief description of the methods you plan to use in your study design (these are not expected to be well developed at this stage). 

**Survey projects should include:**
A description of the topic of your survey and why you think this topic is interesting. 
A description of the scope of your survey (what is / isn't included). 
How you will look for and filter papers (conferences and journals you will include, inclusion criteria). 

### Project interim reports 

Format: PDF document, submitted via GitHub. This will be in the 4-5 page range. 

The interim project report should be a stand-alone document describing your progress so far on the project. Consider it as an early (but incomplete) preliminary version of your final report (see below). It should include early versions of most sections of the anticipated final report. 

- Introduction and Motivation (the main idea of your project stating why you work on this project clearly stating your research question or goal, as well as describing the potential impact your project findings may have on research or practice/users)  
- Related Work (what exists out there that you will build on, what is closest to what you will do, this should show how your project is extending the state of the art or existing research on the topic)  
- Approach and Milestones (what you plan to do in detail for the remainder of the project -- the more specific this is, the more guidance we can provide you, update us on who will do what, how you will work together and by when will you do the work, i.e. clearly state your project *milestones*. For design projects it should be crystal clear who the users are and which collaborative tasks you will support. 
- Implementation and Technology Choice* (for design projects, *you should have at least an MVP of your final design finalized and by now have decided on and experimented with the technology options you are using*)
- Proposed Evaluation Steps (state how you will evaluate the main contribution and what you expect or hope to find through those steps) 
- Risks (what could go wrong, speculate on possible challenges or hurdles you may you face) 
- References (by the end of term, you should ideally have around 20-30 references to CSCW research papers, as well as links to websites or blog posts depending on the scope of the project) (as part of related work section)
- Ethics (details will be posted on this shortly)

### Marking guide for the interim report (worth 10% of the project overall)
- Problem description and motivation (the introduction of the report, how important is the problem addressed, how clearly is the problem described, do you motivate the project well): 10 marks
- Related work (related work and references in the report, have you found the relevant papers or tools related to your project): 20 marks
- Implementation and state of prototype so far, including description of your design decisions (for design projects, for non-design this should include what you have done so far, we do expect to see quite some progress by now!): 35 marks
- Milestones description (who will do what and by when, more detailed is better): 10 marks
- Risks articulation (may just copy from your pitch, but new ones may have surfaced): 5 marks
- Research contribution: 20 marks  (these marks will be awarded based on excellence and creativity of the tool design/evaluation or research contribution, e.g., if you build a tool is it better than other solutions out there)

*For non design projects, the implementation section will include a preliminary study design or details on how you will conduct a survey. You should describe who will benefit from the knowledge you produce and why. 

*Peer evaluations:* In order to receive an individual mark for the project, you need to submit an evaluation for the other members on the team.  Please use the peer evaluation forms on GitHub (available as [word](PeerEval-Interim.docx) and [pdf](PeerEval-Interim.pdf) files).  Please submit these to mstorey@uvic.ca by email.  Please submit this on the day your interim report is due.
 
### Project final submissions 

There are three submissions required for this milestone: 
(updated June 28th)

- a 5 minute video.  For design projects, your video may include your design or a demo of the prototype and any findings from your problem identification or from the evaluation of your solution.  For exploratory research, your video would describe your main research question(s), the method you used to explore that question and the findings from your study.  Upload a link of your video to Slack (project-final channel). In your video, you should also mention the motivation for your project, related work (brief summary or mention), and any ideas for future work you may have.  
- a final report (submitted as PDF), uploaded to GitHub. 
- peer evaluations for other members on your team (this is required before you will be assigned your individual project mark).  Please use the peer evaluation form (available as [word](PeerEval.docx) and [pdf](PeerEval.pdf) files) and submit by email to mstorey@uvic.ca.

The final report should be a stand-alone document describing your 
complete project. You should assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your project and has not read your proposal or interim report (that is, this document subsumes the other deliverables). 

The final report should resemble a conference or journal paper that you might write for your project (but expectations of the quantity of work completed are lower than for a typical research paper, but the closer it is to a submittable form the higher the grade you will receive). 

Include the following information in your report but the template I provide here is only suitable for a design project and is a suggestion of the headings, you may use different ones.  Non-design projects will certainly have different sections - talk to me if you are unsure!

- Introduction 
   - Background information about the background theories, problem, tasks, and users
   - Motivation for why the project was important to pursue and describe the anticipated impact of your work on related research or state of the art
- Related work
   - Other similar solutions to the problem you address
- This should be of the form of a literature review as you would see in a research paper, note everything you discuss in here thought should be related to your project
- Approach
   - Description of your design
   - Reasons for your design choices and alternatives that were considered
- Implementation details
- Findings from the evaluation
- Discussion
   - Strengths and weaknesses of your approach and implementation
   - Lessons you learned
   - Future work that might be done as a follow-up
- References
